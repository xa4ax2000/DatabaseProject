# DatabaseProject
Program using Swing Framework to access a database JDBC using DerbyManager. Queries made via SQLite.

This DatabaseProject is currently just a "Shell" which contains:
  -User Login
  -Account Creation
  -Menu Screen with working menubar
  -Connectivity with Java DB created in Netbeans and managed via Queries (JDBC)
  
This Project is currently inactive now mainly because the task of working on the project felt repetitive; however, 
there are MANY improvements that could be made such as:

  -Incorporation of Spring Framework
    -Utilize logging to help debug
    -Utilize MVC to separate business logic from MVC
    -Utilize dependency injection to make code more clean and less restricted
  -Use a Hash to encrypt passwords such as SHA-256
  -Use Tomcat or Glassfish to establish a connection to a database (Optional -- transition from SQLite to MySQL etc.)
  -Fix algorithm/logic of code to be more efficient.
